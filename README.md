# struct-tools

Tools for working with data containers/structures,
i.e. dicts, classes, lists.

- AlignedDict: align-printed dicts
- DotDict: attribute (dot) style access
- NicePrint: provides `__repr__` (for subclassing) via AlignedDict 
- Deep (nested) attribute access.
- Transposing dict-of-dicts, list-of-lists, and mixed.
- Dict intersection, complement.
- Dict Cartesian product.

## TODO

- Improve (at least the docs of) disparate management of printopts
- Put DotDict and AlignedDict each in their own module
